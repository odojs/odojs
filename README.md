# Odojs

Simple virtual-dom components using the excellent [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) library.

Supports:
- Framework free components - users of the component don't need to include or work with odojs
- Components can be mounted into the DOM and updated with state
- Uni-directional data flow
- Virtual-hyperscript is exposed
- Components can be nested
- Widgets get access to the raw DOM elements
- Components can be rendered on the server as a string
- This can be used as the View in MVC type applications

Suggestions:
- Use with other libraries to help with events / observations and data manipulation
